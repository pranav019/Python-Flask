# list is defined by square brackets
l = ["Bob", "Rofl", "Anne"]
# tuple is defined by () and can't be modified
t = ("Bob", "Rofl", "Anne")
# Set doesn't contain duplicate elements and order is NOT ALWAYS the same you defined
s = {"Bob", "Rofl", "Anne"}
# important points :-
# 1. We can access the elements of set and tuple by [] like l[0] or t[1] but we CAN'T do in set as set doesn't have order
# 2. List and sets (adding and removing) can be modified, but not TUPLE

# VVV IMPORTANT POINT
# 1. to make tuple conatin only one element always end it with a "," comma OTHERWISE IT WILL TREAT IT AS A STRING but not in case of list and set

# 2. if you use empty curly bracs without anything, it creates an empty dictionary
# Example : empty_set = {}
# print(type(empty_set)) === class dictionary

# empty_set = set() ---> now this type is set type with empty set
